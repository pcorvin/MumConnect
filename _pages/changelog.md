# Introduction to MumConnect
The idea to MumConnect came through the regular exchange with my own mum: even though weekly calls are nice to talk about things, photo dumps happen in various family chats as well as writing down todo's once I am back at home. All these things combined sowed the seed for this application and the various modules built in it. As you will have seen by now, it is not available in the AppStore yet, but only opening up for alpha & beta users soon enough. We will keep you posted about the progress within MumConnect.
